### Purpose
---
#### The purpose of this analysis was to take movie data from wikipedia, kaggle, and movielens ratings and compile them together. This project was apart of module 8, for the unc bootcamp data analytics course. Using jupyter notebook, and pgAdmin, the data was transformed using pandas, numpy, re, and sqlalchemy. Data was imported from wikipedia, kaggle and movielens. The wikipedia and kaggle data were merged to fill in missing information and to create one movie dataframe. The rating data from movielens, was broken apart and counts were made by rating. Then the movie dataframe was merged with the ratings information, to create one dataframe that can be used for statistical analysis if needed.
